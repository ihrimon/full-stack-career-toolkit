## 1. JavaScript Fundamentals (Basics)

- [ ] Introduction to JavaScript
      👉 “JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, single-threaded, and dynamically typed programming language that is mainly used in web development. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape. Initially it was called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. Today, it is standardized by ECMAScript.

      The language is lightweight, event-driven, and works seamlessly with HTML and CSS. One of its important characteristics is that it is dynamically typed—meaning variable types are decided at runtime. It’s also single-threaded, but it manages asynchronous tasks efficiently with the event loop.

      In terms of usage, JavaScript can make websites interactive by handling events like clicks, inputs, and hover effects. It allows DOM manipulation, animations, data fetching via APIs, and more. On the server side, JavaScript powers backend development using Node.js. Beyond that, frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue have made it central to frontend development, while React Native and Electron allow us to build mobile and desktop apps.

      Overall, JavaScript has grown into a versatile, cross-platform language that powers both the frontend and backend, making it the heart of modern web applications.”

- [ ] Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)
      👉 var: The oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript. It is function-scoped, supports re-declaration and updating, and is hoisted (initialized as undefined). However, it is less preferred in modern JavaScript due to scope-related issues.

      👉 let: Introduced in ES6 (2015), let is block-scoped, meaning it works only within { }. It allows updating but does not allow re-declaration in the same scope.

      👉 const: Used when the variable reference should not change. For primitive values, the value is fixed, while for arrays and objects, the reference is constant but their contents can still be modified.
